        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Stephan Green and I am a History major from Tufts
          University. However, I haven taken quite a few Computer Science
          courses and have done a lot of programming in the past. In the summer
          of 2020, I have been in a few game jams from itch.io with some friends
          but to be honest, I am the one who did most of the work on those
          games.

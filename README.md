Work Implemented

  Everything listed on the spec has been implemented. The index.html file has a
  picture of my dog instead of a picture of me. The links go towards their
  respective pages. The pages also have links that connect back to the main page
  (index.html).

  The file, resume.html, has my full name, education, experience, skills, and a
  related activity. Each section is separated by a div with a grey background
  color.

  bio.html contains a paragraph that somewhat describes me.

  The CSS file is named style.css and contains 5 rules.

  The HTML and CSS files have been validated through the W3C Validation Services
  and have no errors or warnings.

Collaboration
  I have not collaborated with anyone on this lab. I have only used sources such
  as w3schools.com to refresh my memory on some of the HTML tags.

Hours Taken
  This lab took around 4.5 hours.
